class FlexibleArray():
	"""A wrapper around a numpy array that can expand.

	Classic numpy arrays are fixed in size and so cannot easily be used when
	you do not know the number of elements to store. In contrast, linked lists
	can be used regardless of the number of elements but have a memory overhead
	and use Python's primitive data types, which themselves have significant
	overhead. This thin-wrapper around a numpy array implements the `append` 
	method of a Python list by beginning with an array of a given size and, 
	when the next element would fall off the end of the array, increasing 
	the size of the array. Each expansion requires copying the entire array
	to the new object, incurring a small overhead. There is also a trim method
	to be called at the end which will prune the size down to the actual
	number of stored elements.


	Parameters
	----------
	n_elems: int
		The size of the original numpy array

	step_size: int
		The number of elements to add when the capacity fills up.

	dtype: numpy.dtype, optional
		The dtype of the underlying array. Default is numpy.uint32.

	This function will take in a single fragment file and return the fragments

		If your include/exclude lists have prefixes, perhaps because you have
		many fragment files and wanted to specify the file and the cell jointly,

	max_fragment_length: int, optional
		The maximum length of fragments to consider. Default is 1000.

	start_offset: int, optional

		Default is 5.

		When using verbose mode, a progress bar is displayed. When processing
		multiple files, one can display vertically stacked progress bars, one 
		for each file by controlling their positioning with this parameter.
		If None, the progress bar displays at the bottom of the screen. Default

	_cell_names: list

	_cell_name_mapping: dict
		A dictionary where the keys are cell barcodes, and also the reverse
